# Archaeology Data Infrastructures

This is a repository where I am currently writing my dissertation thesis.

This is still a work-in-progress thing, if you wnat to have a look at it, do so, but consider yourself warned.

The whole thing is published as a GitHub page here: <https://petrpajdla.github.io/dataInfrastructures/>.
