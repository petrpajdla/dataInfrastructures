One evening I simply decided to give *Quarto* publishing a try and set this whole thing up in less then an hour or so.\n\n### Notes on writing\n\nThis note is written mostly for a future me, in case I need to set up the working environment again on a different machine and to serve as a memo if I forget how to continue.\n\nAs of November 2022, this is written on [Archlabs](https://archlabslinux.com/) *GNU/Linux* machine, mostly in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor and sometimes in [RStudio](https://posit.co/). Changes are tracked with *Git* and a remote repository is on *GitHub* (see the note above), same as the rendered website.\nThe rendered version of the manuscript is in the branch `gh-pages`.\nSee a guide on how to set this up [here](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html).\nThe online version is published with this command:\n\n```{.bash filename=\"Terminal\"}\nquarto publish gh-pages\n```\n\nIn my point of view, there are numerous advantages to scientific writing in this manner over traditional *Office*-based approach. A non-exhaustive list of why to do scientific writing this way is below.\n\n- **Plain text**  \n  Writing in plain text enhanced with a simple *Markdown* syntax and some *Quarto* elements is great because from one source document, a *.pdf*, *.html*, *.docx* (and probably more) document formats can be rendered using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).\n- **Version control**  \n  Tracking changes using *git* is easily implemented when writing in a plain text. Keeping track of any changes in the manuscript is obviously crucial for any later revisions etc.\n- **Simple citation management**  \n  Bibliography is organized using [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) with [Better BibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) extension which is used to export (and keep updated) necessary collections in a parent folder of the manuscript as *.bib* files. My *Zotero* library is [here](https://www.zotero.org/knytt). To format the citations, a citation style of the *Journal of Computer Applications in Archaeology* is used (.csl file was obtained [here](https://www.zotero.org/styles/)).\n- **Embedded code**  \n  Code blocks (and the associated results) can be easily embedded in the text. My language of choice is *R*.
