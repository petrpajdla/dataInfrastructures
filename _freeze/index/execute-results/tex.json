One evening I simply decided to give *Quarto* publishing a try and set this whole thing up in less then an hour or so.\n\n### Notes on writing\n\nThis note is written mostly for a future me, in case I need to set up the working environment again on a different machine and to serve as a memo if I forget how to continue.\n\nAs of November 2022, this is written on [Archlabs](https://archlabslinux.com/) *GNU/Linux* machine, mostly in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor and sometimes in [RStudio](https://posit.co/). Changes are tracked with *Git* and a remote repository is on *GitHub* (see the note above), same as the rendered website.\nThe rendered version of the manuscript is in the branch `gh-pages`.\nSee a guide on how to set this up [here](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html).\n\nIn my point of view, there are numerous advantages to scientific writing in this manner over traditional *Office*-based approach. A non-exhaustive list of why to do scientific writing this way is below.\n\n- **Plain text**\n  Writing in plain text enhanced with a simple *Markdown* syntax and some *Quarto* elements is great because from one source document, a *.pdf*, *.html*, *.docx* (and probably more) document formats can be rendered using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).\n- **Version control**\n  Tracking changes using *git* is easily implemented when writing in a plain text. Keeping track of any changes in the manuscript is obviously crucial for any later revisions etc.\n- **Simple citation management**\n  Bibliography is organized using [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) with [Better BibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) extension which is used to export (and keep updated) necessary collections in a parent folder of the manuscript as *.bib* files. My *Zotero* library is [here](https://www.zotero.org/knytt). To format the citations, a citation style of the *Journal of Computer Applications in Archaeology* is used (.csl file was obtained [here](https://www.zotero.org/styles/)).\n- **Embedded code**\n  Code blocks (and the associated results) can be easily embedded in the text. My language of choice is *R*. For more information on reproducibility see @marwick2017 and @marwick2018a.\n- **Reproduciblity**\n  Using `renv` package makes reproducibility of the whole project less tedious than I would normally expect. Hints:\n\n    - use `renv::status()` to check the status of the project,\n    - use `renv::install()` (`install.packages()` is aliased to it as well) to install new packages,\n    - use `renv::snapshot()` to update the lockfile,\n    - use `renv::restore()` to restore the state of the project/dependencies recorded in the lock file\n    - use `renv::update()` to updated the project.\n\nSee [https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) for more details, as well as this figure:\n\n![Basic usage of `renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.png)\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## In-text citations\n\n```\n@citekey -> Author (year)\n-@citekey -> (year)\n[@citekey] -> (Author, year)\n@citekey [p.
