    "text": "Thesis outline\n\nHere is a brief outline of the structure of the thesis. In Chapter 1, Theory, the foundation is given by defining basic terms, data, data infrastructures etc. Then, theoretical approaches the work spans from are discussed and the concept of data in archaeology theorized. The dichotomy between archaeology as data- and/or theory-driven science is debated.\nIn Chapter 2, Method, methodological boundaries are set up.\nChapter 3, Data, introduces data sources that are used here. Understanding the data models employed in various data sources is vital for any subsequent steps taken in the analytical process. Special attention is thus given to analysing how reality and facts are represented by the data models of used sources. A data management plan (Section 3.1) details how data is handled in this research."

As Kitchin (2022, 15) states, “Data are not simply captured or recorded, but are the product of discursively framed and technically mediated processes.”\n“The production of data is a social practice, conducted through structured and structuring fields (e.g. methods, concepts, expertise, institutions) that are shaped by and contribute to configurations of power and knowledge.” (Ruppert, Isin, and Bigo 2017)\n“(…) databases are designed and build to hold certain kinds of data and enable certain kinds of analysis, and how they are structured has profound consequences as to what queries and analysis can be performed.” (Ruppert 2012)\n\n\n1.1.2 Data infrastructures\nAs I was saying in the Section 1.1.1."

The text is processed into three outputs, a website (HTML document), a PDF document and a MS Word document using Quarto. The plain text version, same as the rendered website, is hosted at GitHub. The text was mostly written in the Visual Code Studio, analysis were mostly performed using Rstudio or terminal. Library was organized using Zotero.\nRaster graphics were created and edited using GIMP, vector graphics using Inkscape. All the GIS operations that required graphical user interface (GUI), or were more conveniently performed in a GUI, were done in QGIS.\nSome data were prepared, extracted or processed using basic GNU/Linux shell or SQL commands or scripts. Data from Wikidata was queried using SPARQL. Any analysis was mostly done in R, a language for statistical computing and graphics (rcore?). Various packages were used, the most important packages are listed here, the complete list is in an Appendix\n\n2.1.1 Reproduciblity"

    "text": "3.1 Data management plan\nGood data stewardship is a crucial element in Open Science (Mons 2018, 1–5), an umbrella concept for how scientific research is conducted in a way that knowledge is reusable, modifiable and redistributable. The data management plan (DMP) then stands at the very beginning of every such endeavour. In its essence, a DMP is a stand-alone document detailing how data is handled at each of the steps in its life cycle. This implies that it is not a static, but a living record of how the data was captured, created, curated, selected, analysed, interpreted, shared, and archived in course of a project or after its end. A DMP helps in adhering to the FAIR principles, i.e. making data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, a set of propositions enabling more effective knowledge discovery, collaboration, and data reuse (Wilkinson et al. 2016; Hollander et al. 2019).\nThis DMP is partly based on the structure given in the Data Stewardship Wizard (Pergl et al. 2019), an online tool dedicated to cooperative creation of DMPs, templates created in the Ariadne project (Doorn and Ronzino 2022) and my own ideas on good DMP practice. It is included both as part of the text and as a standalone machine actionable file (link?). \n\n3.1.1 Created, collected and re-used data\n\nData re-use\nThe work is predominantly based on re-using existing data. The sources of data are listed in Section 3.2. I presume that there are many pre-existing data sets in the Czech archaeology, but most of them are either inaccessible or not findable, i.e. we cannot be sure they even exist. The single most complete source for archaeology data in the Czech Republic is without a doubt the AIS CR infrastructure.\nThere are several well published data sets covering the area of the Czech Republic in the Journal of Open Archaeology Data, the radiocarbon data by Tkáč and Kolář (2021) and the Neolithic settlements data set by Pajdla and Trampota (2021). These have an advantage of well formulated access and re-use policies, explicit licence and other conditions for use.\n\n\n\nData creation and collection\n\n\n\n\nVocabularies\n\nI am explicitly using vocabularies that are inherent to data sources from which the data is reused. A principal and authoritative vocabulary for archaeology and related fields is the Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT). Getty AAT subjects are used by the ARIADNE infrastructure and many other archaeology infrastructures are mapping their vocabularies to the AAT subjects. The emerging ARIADNE AO_Cat formal ontology is also taken into account when interacting with ARIADNE services. The AIS CR vocabularies, although implicit to the data, are yet to be published. A possibly incomplete version can be reverse engineered from the available data sets. If reconciliation between data from different data sources is necessary, the AAT is used to map between them.\n\n\n\nFile naming conventions\nPersistent identifiers?\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Data processing\nHow will you work with the data? Do you have/need storage? Do you do backups? Are you using object-store? Are you using relational database? Graph database? Triple store? How are changes in data managed?\n\n\n3.1.3 Interpretation\nSpecify/list data formats you will be using and their structure. Will different data be integrated?\n\n\n3.1.4 Data preservation\nWhat data sets are you producing? Is data long-term archived? Will it be usable and accessible after a long period of time?\n\n\n3.1.5 Access to data\nWill the data be as open as possible? What are the reasons your data cannot became open?"
