    "text": "Thesis outline\n\nHere is a brief outline of the structure of the thesis. In Chapter 1, Theory, the foundation is given by defining basic terms, data, data infrastructures etc. Then, theoretical approaches the work spans from are discussed and the concept of data in archaeology theorized. The dichotomy between archaeology as data- and/or theory-driven science is debated.\nIn Chapter 2, Method, methodological boundaries are set up.\nChapter 3, Data, introduces data sources that are used here. Understanding the data models employed in various data sources is vital for any subsequent steps taken in the analytical process. Special attention is thus given to analysing how reality and facts are represented by the data models of used sources. A data management plan (Section 3.1) details how data is handled in this research."

    "text": "1.1 Definitions and terminology\n\n1.1.1 Data\nThe term data is used in a plural form what is the current scientific convention (Kitchin 2022, xvii). As Kitchin (2022, 15) states, “Data are not simply captured or recorded, but are the product of discursively framed and technically mediated processes.”\n\nRuppert, Evelyn, Engin Isin, and Didier Bigo. 2017. “Data Politics.” Big Data & Society 4 (2). SAGE Publications Ltd: 2053951717717749. doi:10.1177/2053951717717749.\n“The production of data is a social practice, conducted through structured and structuring fields (e.g. methods, concepts, expertise, institutions) that are shaped by and contribute to configurations of power and knowledge.” (Ruppert, Isin, and Bigo 2017)\n“(…) databases are designed and build to hold certain kinds of data and enable certain kinds of analysis, and how they are structured has profound consequences as to what queries and analysis can be performed.” (Ruppert 2012)\n\nRuppert, Evelyn. 2012. “The Governmental Topologies of Database Devices.” Theory, Culture & Society 29 (4-5). SAGE Publications Ltd: 116–136. doi:10.1177/0263276412439428.\nanalogue vs born-digital\n\n\n1.1.2 Infrastructures\nAlthough infrastructures became quite a buzzword in recent years both among the policy makers and researchers, it is rather difficult to define what an infrastructure actually is. Many slightly different variations of more-less the same name and concept are circulating in official documents, various reports, research articles etc. Thus, we encounter terms such as research infrastructures, large research infrastructures, open science infrastrucutres, data infrastructures, and perhaps more, even though most of their definitions are variations of the very same concept.\nHallonsten (2020) maps the field of European (research) infrastructures and identifies the principal problem as the difficulty to come up with a single definition that would fit all of those who are considered to be (or consider themselves to be) an infrastructure. Hallonsten (2020, 630) concludes that:\n\nHallonsten, Olof. 2020. “Research Infrastructures in Europe: The Hype and the Field.” European Review 28 (4). Cambridge University Press: 617–635. doi:10.1017/S1062798720000095.\n\n(…) “while a politically viable definition seems to be either already in place (…) or unneeded, an analytically workable definition is out of reach unless the scope is limited and the aim of the definition is made more precise.”“\n\nIn the next paragraphs, we look at several of the political definitions of research infrastructures and later we focus on an analytical definition of data infrastructures.\n\nPolitical definitions\nIn the European Union, research infrastructures are currently defined in the Article 2(1) of EU Regulation No 2021/695 establishing Horizon Europe (2021) as facilities providing resources and services for the research communities in their respective fields. These include:\n\nRegulation (EU) 2021/695 of the European Parliament and of the Council. 2021. 32021R0695. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32021R0695.\n\nhuman resources, major scientific equipment or sets of instruments;\ncollections, archives or scientific data, i.e. knowledge-related facilities;\ncomputing systems and communication networks;\nany other research and innovation infrastructure of a unique nature open to external users.\n\nThe Regulation also states that infrastructures may be used beyond research, i.e. for education, public services etc. This broad definition given by the European Union covers almost any kind of an infrastructure. In the legal framework of the Czech Republic, given by Act No 130/2002 Coll. on the Support of Research, Experimental Development and Innovation (2002), Article 2(2), large research infrastructure is defined as follow (english translation from Roadmap of Large Research Infrastructures 2019):\n\nAct No 130/2002 Coll. (The Act on the Support of Research, Experimental Development and Innovation), as Amended. 2002.\n\nRoadmap of Large Research Infrastructures of the Czech Republic for the Years 2016-2022. 2019. Update 2019. Prague: Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports. https://www.vyzkumne-infrastruktury.cz/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Aktualizace-Cestovn%C3%AD-mapy-2019_en.pdf.\n\n“(…) a facility necessary for conducting comprehensive research and development with high financial and technology demands, approved by the Government and established to be also used by other research organisations.”\n\nThis political definition is rather an opportunistic one in demanding that the infrastructure is approved by the Czech government and has high financial and technology demands. Lastly, the UNESCO Open Science Recommendation (2021) adds to the research infrastructures a strong element of open science, addressing them as open science infrastructures.\n\nUNESCO. 2021. UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science. Paris: UNESCO. https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949.locale=en.\nTo conclude, the political definitions of research infrastructures are mostly broad enough to fit any kind of a facility, that is deemed appropriate. This point is highlighted especially in the Czech definition, where an approval of the Government is required. In general, there is an emphasis on provision of services (etc.) to various stakeholder communities and cooperation. In the EU Regulation, a subset of a larger field of infrastructures is labeled knowledge-related facilities, it is exactly this part that is discussed here as data infrastructures.\n\n\nData infrastructures\nKitchin (2022, 47–48) builds up the definition of data infrastructures by comparing them to data holdings and data archives. Data holdings are any data stored informally, presumably by an individual (scientist), without long-term preservation or sharing for reuse in mind. Such data are inevitably lost when the researcher retires, dies (etc.), because proper metadata descriptions are missing and the data, although they might be organised in some way, lack documentation and it is difficult, if not impossible, to reconstruct the context of the data. In contrast, data archives are formal collections that are structured, curated and documented by appropriate metadata with plans for preservation, access and discoverability.\n\nKitchin, Rob. 2022. The Data Revolution: A Critical Analysis of Big Data, Open Data & Data Infrastructures. 2nd ed. Los Angeles, California: SAGE Publications.\nThe role of an interconnected digital world is then highlighted in Kitchin’s definition of a data infrastructure (Kitchin 2022, 50):\n\n“A data infrastructure is a digital means for storing, sharing, connecting and consuming data holdings and archives across the internet.”\n\nIn a broader sense, infrastructures are information systems, repositories, archives, databases, sets of equipment and instruments etc. shared by multiple shareholder groups that are essential in supporting open science and research."

    "text": "3.1 Data management plan\nGood data stewardship is a crucial element in Open Science (Mons 2018, 1–5), an umbrella concept for how scientific research is conducted in a way that knowledge is reusable, modifiable and redistributable. The data management plan (DMP) then stands at the very beginning of every such endeavour. In its essence, a DMP is a stand-alone document detailing how data is handled at each of the steps in its life cycle. This implies that it is not a static, but a living record of how the data was captured, created, curated, selected, analysed, interpreted, shared, and archived in course of a project or after its end. A DMP helps in adhering to the FAIR principles, i.e. making data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, a set of propositions enabling more effective knowledge discovery, collaboration, and data reuse (Wilkinson et al. 2016; Hollander et al. 2019).\n\nMons, Barend. 2018.

It is included both as part of the text and as a standalone machine actionable file (link?). \n\n3.1.1 Created, collected and re-used data\n\nData re-use\nThe work is predominantly based on re-using existing data. The sources of data are listed in Section 3.2. I presume that there are many pre-existing data sets in the Czech archaeology, but most of them are either inaccessible or not findable, i.e. we cannot be sure they even exist. The single most complete source for archaeology data in the Czech Republic is without a doubt the AIS CR infrastructure.\nThere are several well published data sets covering the area of the Czech Republic in the Journal of Open Archaeology Data, the radiocarbon data by Tkáč and Kolář (2021) and the Neolithic settlements data set by Pajdla and Trampota (2021). These have an advantage of well formulated access and re-use policies, explicit licence and other conditions for use.\n\n\nTkáč, Peter, and Jan Kolář. 2021. “Towards New Demography Proxies and Regional Chronologies: Radiocarbon Dates from Archaeological Contexts Located in the Czech Republic Covering the Period Between 10,000 BC and AD 1250.” Journal of Open Archaeology Data 9 (0, 0).

Ubiquity Press: 13. doi:10.5334/joad.88.\n\n\nData creation and collection\n\n\n\n\nVocabularies\n\nI am explicitly using vocabularies that are inherent to data sources from which the data is reused. A principal and authoritative vocabulary for archaeology and related fields is the Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT). Getty AAT subjects are used by the ARIADNE infrastructure and many other archaeology infrastructures are mapping their vocabularies to the AAT subjects. The emerging ARIADNE AO_Cat formal ontology is also taken into account when interacting with ARIADNE services. The AIS CR vocabularies, although implicit to the data, are yet to be published. A possibly incomplete version can be reverse engineered from the available data sets. If reconciliation between data from different data sources is necessary, the AAT is used to map between them.\n\n\n\nFile naming conventions\nPersistent identifiers?\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Data processing\nHow will you work with the data?
