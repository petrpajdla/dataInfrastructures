    "text": "Preface\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis is a website for the work-in-progress PhD thesis of mine. It is not intended to be read by anyone except me (and maybe few other people) yet. If you do flick through it anyway, consider yourself warned. It might be messy at some places and will definitely undergo serious rewriting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work can be read online at https://petrpajdla.github.io/dataInfrastructures/. The source repository is on GitHub at https://github.com/petrpajdla/dataInfrastructures/.\n\n\n\nThis document is created in an open-source Quarto scientific and technical publishing system. You might be asking why is it published and written like this even if it is not intended for any audiences except myself yet. I have no answer to this. One evening I simply decided to give Quarto publishing a try and set this whole thing up in less then an hour or so.\n\nNotes on writing\nThis note is written mostly for a future me, in case I need to set up the working environment again on a different machine and to serve as a memo if I forget how to continue.\nAs of November 2022, this is written on Archlabs GNU/Linux machine, mostly in Visual Studio Code editor and sometimes in RStudio. Changes are tracked with Git and a remote repository is on GitHub (see the note above), same as the rendered website. The rendered version of the manuscript is in the branch gh-pages. See a guide on how to set this up here. The online version is published with this command:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto publish gh-pages\n\nIn my point of view, there are numerous advantages to scientific writing in this manner over traditional Office-based approach. A non-exhaustive list of why to do scientific writing this way is below.\n\nPlain text Writing in plain text enhanced with a simple Markdown syntax and some Quarto elements is great because from one source document, a .pdf, .html, .docx (and probably more) document formats can be rendered using pandoc.\nVersion control Tracking changes using git is easily implemented when writing in a plain text. Keeping track of any changes in the manuscript is obviously crucial for any later revisions etc.\nSimple citation management Bibliography is organized using Zotero with Better BibTeX extension which is used to export (and keep updated) necessary collections in a parent folder of the manuscript as .bib files. My Zotero library is here. To format the citations, a citation style of the Journal of Computer Applications in Archaeology is used (.csl file was obtained here).\nEmbedded code Code blocks (and the associated results) can be easily embedded in the text. My language of choice is R.

In Chapter 1, Theory, the foundation is given by defining basic terms, data, data infrastructures etc. Then, theoretical approaches the work spans from are discussed and the concept of data in archaeology theorized. The dichotomy between archaeology as data- and/or theory-driven science is debated.\nIn Chapter 2, Method, methodological boundaries are set up.\nChapter 3, Data, introduces data sources that are used here. Understanding the data models employed in various data sources is vital for any subsequent steps taken in the analytical process. Special attention is thus given to analysing how reality and facts are represented by the data models of used sources. A data management plan (Section 3.1) details how data is handled in this research."

    "section": "1.1 Definitions and terminology",
    "text": "1.1 Definitions and terminology\nThis section presents a discussion of how I (and others) understand data and data infrastructures. Data are a corner stone of this work and looking closely at how scholars, policy makers, and various other stakeholders define them is crucial for further understanding what is possible and what is not in the process of knowledge building.\n\n1.1.1 Data\nIn the current information age, word data1 is almost omnipresent and it became such a generic term that it is somewhat challenging to define. Most of the definitions understand data as building blocks of information (e.g. Kitchin 2022, 4). These pieces of information are percieved as pre-factual and pre-analytical. That is, in contrast to facts, false data are data nonetheless, disproven facts are no longer facts (Rosenberg 2013, 17–18). Thus data are understood as incontrovertible and non-deconstructibe units. These assumptions migh lead to an impression that data exist in the outside world as entities or phenomena independent of the one observing them. And this is indeed one way to comprehend data, as ‘things given’ that just need to be discoverd (cf. Huggett 2020). This inductive explanation of data brings in itself a danger that the process of discovering the data is viewed as an atheoretical endeavour.1 In this text, I adhere to the current scholarly convention as noted by Kitchin (2022, xvii), i.e. using term data in the plural form, with a singular form of datum.\nKitchin, Rob. 2022. The Data Revolution: A Critical Analysis of Big Data, Open Data & Data Infrastructures. 2nd ed. Los Angeles, California: SAGE Publications.\n\nOn the contrary, data understood as ‘things made’ are created at the moment when they are captured by observation, measurement, or derived from other data. This implies theory-laden creative process of data generation, recording, etc. In this case, it is clear that the one creating or recording the data does that based on the experience, objective and knowledge he/she has. The whole process of data recording, creation, or capture is thus discursively framed and technically mediated (cf. Kitchin 2022, 4–15; Huggett 2020). As Kitchin notes, what we label as data are in fact capta, i.e. ‘things taken’.\n\nHuggett, Jeremy. 2020. “Is Big Digital Data Different? Towards a New Archaeological Paradigm.” Journal of Field Archaeology 45 (February): S8–S17. doi:10.1080/00934690.2020.1713281.\n\nRuppert, Evelyn, Engin Isin, and Didier Bigo. 2017. “Data Politics.” Big Data & Society 4 (2). SAGE Publications Ltd: 2053951717717749. doi:10.1177/2053951717717749.\nRuppert, Isin, and Bigo (2017) voice the idea that the practice of data production does not happen through unstructured social (and/or political) practices, but through structured and structuring fields that add to configurations of power and knowledge. In this section we went from understanding data as ubiquitous phenomena that are waiting out there to be discovered to capta that are actively and creatively made, recorded, generated etc. by a theory- and agenda-laden researcher. What more, the practice of data production is recognized as being shaped by and contributing to structure of power and knowledge. What data are recorded and how they are structured has consequences as to what can be later devised, i.e. what knowlege can be generated.\n\nTalking about how chosen strategies in data recording and generation may influence the knowledge generated further along the way an idea of good and bad data might come to mind. Bad data, like false data, do not exist. Data can be useless, but their value is probably more determined by the current goal in mind. Nevertheless, there are some signs of good-quality data as cited2 by Kitchin (2022, 4):2 Author’s note: Kitchin cites Rosenberg (2013), but I was not able to locate this part in Rosenberg’s paper, which is primarily focused on the history of the term data in English language, not the quality of data.\nRosenberg, Daniel. 2013. “Data Before the Fact.” In ’Raw Data’ Is an Oxymoron, edited by L Gitelman, 15–40. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.\n\n\nthey are discreet and intelligible, i.e. each datum is individual, separate and separable, and clearly defined;\nthey are aggregative, that is they can be built into sets;\nthey have associated metadata (data about data);\nthey can be linked to other datasets to provide insights not available from a single dataset.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Infrastructures\nAlthough infrastructures became quite a buzzword in recent years both among the policy makers and researchers, it is rather difficult to define what an infrastructure actually is. Many slightly different variations of more-less the same name and concept are circulating in official documents, various reports, research articles etc. Thus, we encounter terms such as research infrastructures, large research infrastructures, open science infrastrucutres, data infrastructures, and perhaps more, even though most of their definitions are variations of the very same concept.\nHallonsten (2020) maps the field of European (research) infrastructures and identifies the principal problem as the difficulty to come up with a single definition that would fit all of those who are considered to be (or consider themselves to be) an infrastructure. Hallonsten (2020, 630) concludes that:\n\nHallonsten, Olof. 2020. “Research Infrastructures in Europe: The Hype and the Field.” European Review 28 (4). Cambridge University Press: 617–635. doi:10.1017/S1062798720000095.\n\n(…) “while a politically viable definition seems to be either already in place (…) or unneeded, an analytically workable definition is out of reach unless the scope is limited and the aim of the definition is made more precise.”\n\nIn the next paragraphs, we look at several of the political definitions of research infrastructures and later we focus on an analytical definition of data infrastructures.\n\nPolitical definitions\nIn the European Union, research infrastructures are currently defined in the Article 2(1) of EU Regulation No 2021/695 establishing Horizon Europe (2021) as facilities providing resources and services for the research communities in their respective fields. These include:\n\nRegulation (EU) 2021/695 of the European Parliament and of the Council. 2021. 32021R0695. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32021R0695.\n\nhuman resources, major scientific equipment or sets of instruments;\ncollections, archives or scientific data, i.e. knowledge-related facilities;\ncomputing systems and communication networks;\nany other research and innovation infrastructure of a unique nature open to external users.\n\nThe Regulation also states that infrastructures may be used beyond research, i.e. for education, public services etc. This broad definition given by the European Union covers almost any kind of an infrastructure. In the legal framework of the Czech Republic, given by Act No 130/2002 Coll. on the Support of Research, Experimental Development and Innovation (2002), Article 2(2), large research infrastructure is defined as follow (english translation from Roadmap of Large Research Infrastructures 2019):\n\nAct No 130/2002 Coll. (The Act on the Support of Research, Experimental Development and Innovation), as Amended. 2002.\n\nRoadmap of Large Research Infrastructures of the Czech Republic for the Years 2016-2022. 2019. Update 2019. Prague: Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports. https://www.vyzkumne-infrastruktury.cz/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Aktualizace-Cestovn%C3%AD-mapy-2019_en.pdf.\n\n“(…) a facility necessary for conducting comprehensive research and development with high financial and technology demands, approved by the Government and established to be also used by other research organisations.”\n\nThis political definition is rather an opportunistic one in demanding that the infrastructure is approved by the Czech government and has high financial and technology demands. Lastly, the UNESCO Open Science Recommendation (2021) adds to the research infrastructures a strong element of open science, addressing them as open science infrastructures.\n\nUNESCO. 2021. UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science. Paris: UNESCO. https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949.locale=en.\nTo conclude, the political definitions of research infrastructures are mostly broad enough to fit any kind of a facility, that is deemed appropriate. This point is highlighted especially in the Czech definition, where an approval of the Government is required. In general, there is an emphasis on provision of services (etc.) to various stakeholder communities and cooperation. In the EU Regulation, a subset of a larger field of infrastructures is labeled knowledge-related facilities, it is exactly this part that is discussed here as data infrastructures.\n\n\nData infrastructures\nKitchin (2022, 47–48) builds up the definition of data infrastructures by comparing them to data holdings and data archives. Data holdings are any data stored informally, presumably by an individual (scientist), without long-term preservation or sharing for reuse in mind. Such data are inevitably lost when the researcher retires, dies (etc.), because proper metadata descriptions are missing and the data, although they might be organised in some way, lack documentation and it is difficult, if not impossible, to reconstruct the context of the data. In contrast, data archives are formal collections that are structured, curated and documented by appropriate metadata with plans for preservation, access and discoverability.\nThe role of an interconnected digital world is then highlighted in Kitchin’s definition of a data infrastructure (Kitchin 2022, 50):\n\n“A data infrastructure is a digital means for storing, sharing, connecting and consuming data holdings and archives across the internet.”\n\nIn a broader sense, infrastructures are information systems, repositories, archives, databases, sets of equipment and instruments etc. shared by multiple shareholder groups that are essential in supporting open science and research."

    "text": "3.1 Data management plan\nGood data stewardship is a crucial element in Open Science (Mons 2018, 1–5), an umbrella concept for how scientific research is conducted in a way that knowledge is reusable, modifiable and redistributable. The data management plan (DMP) then stands at the very beginning of every such endeavour. In its essence, a DMP is a stand-alone document detailing how data is handled at each of the steps in its life cycle. This implies that it is not a static, but a living record of how the data was captured, created, curated, selected, analysed, interpreted, shared, and archived in course of a project or after its end. A DMP helps in adhering to the FAIR principles, i.e. making data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, a set of propositions enabling more effective knowledge discovery, collaboration, and data reuse (Wilkinson et al. 2016; Hollander et al. 2019).\n\nMons, Barend. 2018.

It is included both as part of the text and as a standalone machine actionable file (link?). \n\n3.1.1 Created, collected and re-used data\n\nData re-use\nThe work is predominantly based on re-using existing data. The sources of data are listed in Section 3.2. I presume that there are many pre-existing data sets in the Czech archaeology, but most of them are either inaccessible or not findable, i.e. we cannot be sure they even exist. The single most complete source for archaeology data in the Czech Republic is without a doubt the AIS CR infrastructure.\nThere are several well published data sets covering the area of the Czech Republic in the Journal of Open Archaeology Data, the radiocarbon data by Tkáč and Kolář (2021) and the Neolithic settlements data set by Pajdla and Trampota (2021). These have an advantage of well formulated access and re-use policies, explicit licence and other conditions for use.\n\n\nTkáč, Peter, and Jan Kolář. 2021. “Towards New Demography Proxies and Regional Chronologies: Radiocarbon Dates from Archaeological Contexts Located in the Czech Republic Covering the Period Between 10,000 BC and AD 1250.” Journal of Open Archaeology Data 9 (0, 0).

A principal and authoritative vocabulary for archaeology and related fields is the Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT). Getty AAT subjects are used by the ARIADNE infrastructure and many other archaeology infrastructures are mapping their vocabularies to the AAT subjects. The emerging ARIADNE AO_Cat formal ontology is also taken into account when interacting with ARIADNE services. The AIS CR vocabularies, although implicit to the data, are yet to be published. A possibly incomplete version can be reverse engineered from the available data sets. If reconciliation between data from different data sources is necessary, the AAT is used to map between them.\n\n\n\nFile naming conventions\nPersistent identifiers?\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Data processing\nHow will you work with the data?
