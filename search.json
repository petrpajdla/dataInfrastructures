    "text": "Preface\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis is a website for the work-in-progress PhD thesis of mine. It is not intended to be read by anyone except me (and maybe few other people) yet. If you do flick through it anyway, consider yourself warned. It might be messy at some places and will definitely undergo serious rewriting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work can be read online at https://petrpajdla.github.io/dataInfrastructures/. The source repository is on GitHub at https://github.com/petrpajdla/dataInfrastructures/.\n\n\n\nThis document is created in an open-source Quarto scientific and technical publishing system. You might be asking why is it published and written like this even if it is not intended for any audiences except myself yet. I have no answer to this. One evening I simply decided to give Quarto publishing a try and set this whole thing up in less then an hour or so.\n\nNotes on writing\nThis note is written mostly for a future me, in case I need to set up the working environment again on a different machine and to serve as a memo if I forget how to continue.\nAs of November 2022, this is written on Archlabs GNU/Linux machine, mostly in Visual Studio Code editor and sometimes in RStudio. Changes are tracked with Git and a remote repository is on GitHub (see the note above), same as the rendered website. The rendered version of the manuscript is in the branch gh-pages. See a guide on how to set this up here. The online version is published with this command:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto publish gh-pages\n\nIn my point of view, there are numerous advantages to scientific writing in this manner over traditional Office-based approach. A non-exhaustive list of why to do scientific writing this way is below.\n\nPlain text\nWriting in plain text enhanced with a simple Markdown syntax and some Quarto elements is great because from one source document, a .pdf, .html, .docx (and probably more) document formats can be rendered using pandoc.\nVersion control\nTracking changes using git is easily implemented when writing in a plain text. Keeping track of any changes in the manuscript is obviously crucial for any later revisions etc.\nSimple citation management\nBibliography is organized using Zotero with Better BibTeX extension which is used to export (and keep updated) necessary collections in a parent folder of the manuscript as .bib files. My Zotero library is here. To format the citations, a citation style of the Journal of Computer Applications in Archaeology is used (.csl file was obtained here).\nEmbedded code\nCode blocks (and the associated results) can be easily embedded in the text. My language of choice is R. For more information on reproducibility see Marwick (2017) and Marwick, Boettiger, and Mullen (2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-text citations\n\n\n\n\n\n@citekey        -> Author (year)\n-@citekey       -> (year)\n[@citekey]      -> (Author, year)\n@citekey [p.

In Chapter 1, Theory, the foundation is given by defining basic terms, data, data infrastructures etc. Then, theoretical approaches the work spans from are discussed and the concept of data in archaeology theorized. The dichotomy between archaeology as data- and/or theory-driven science is debated.\nIn Chapter 2, Method, methodological boundaries are set up.\nChapter 3, Data, introduces data sources that are used here. Understanding the data models employed in various data sources is vital for any subsequent steps taken in the analytical process. Special attention is thus given to analysing how reality and facts are represented by the data models of used sources. A data management plan (Section 3.1) details how data is handled in this research."

    "text": "3.1 Data management plan\nGood data stewardship is a crucial element in Open Science (Mons 2018, 1–5), an umbrella concept for how scientific research is conducted in a way that knowledge is reusable, modifiable and redistributable. The data management plan (DMP) then stands at the very beginning of every such endeavour. In its essence, a DMP is a stand-alone document detailing how data is handled at each of the steps in its life cycle. This implies that it is not a static, but a living record of how the data was captured, created, curated, selected, analysed, interpreted, shared, and archived in course of a project or after its end. A DMP helps in adhering to the FAIR principles, i.e. making data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, a set of propositions enabling more effective knowledge discovery, collaboration, and data reuse (Wilkinson et al. 2016; Hollander et al. 2019).\nThis DMP is partly based on the structure given in the Data Stewardship Wizard (Pergl et al. 2019), an online tool dedicated to cooperative creation of DMPs, templates created in the Ariadne project (Doorn and Ronzino 2022) and my own ideas on good DMP practice. It is included both as part of the text and as a standalone machine actionable file (link?). \n\n3.1.1 Created, collected and re-used data\n\nData re-use\nThe work is predominantly based on re-using existing data. The sources of data are listed in Section 3.2. I presume that there are many pre-existing data sets in the Czech archaeology, but most of them are either inaccessible or not findable, i.e. we cannot be sure they even exist. The single most complete source for archaeology data in the Czech Republic is without a doubt the AIS CR infrastructure.\nThere are several well published data sets covering the area of the Czech Republic in the Journal of Open Archaeology Data, the radiocarbon data by Tkáč and Kolář (2021) and the Neolithic settlements data set by Pajdla and Trampota (2021). These have an advantage of well formulated access and re-use policies, explicit licence and other conditions for use.\n\n\n\nData creation and collection\n\n\n\n\nVocabularies\n\nI am explicitly using vocabularies that are inherent to data sources from which the data is reused. A principal and authoritative vocabulary for archaeology and related fields is the Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT). Getty AAT subjects are used by the ARIADNE infrastructure and many other archaeology infrastructures are mapping their vocabularies to the AAT subjects. The emerging ARIADNE AO_Cat formal ontology is also taken into account when interacting with ARIADNE services. The AIS CR vocabularies, although implicit to the data, are yet to be published. A possibly incomplete version can be reverse engineered from the available data sets. If reconciliation between data from different data sources is necessary, the AAT is used to map between them.\n\n\n\nFile naming conventions\nPersistent identifiers?\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Data processing\nHow will you work with the data? Do you have/need storage? Do you do backups? Are you using object-store? Are you using relational database? Graph database? Triple store? How are changes in data managed?\n\n\n3.1.3 Interpretation\nSpecify/list data formats you will be using and their structure. Will different data be integrated?\n\n\n3.1.4 Data preservation\nWhat data sets are you producing? Is data long-term archived? Will it be usable and accessible after a long period of time?\n\n\n3.1.5 Access to data\nWill the data be as open as possible? What are the reasons your data cannot became open?"
