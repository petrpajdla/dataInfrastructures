    "text": "Preface\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis is a website for the work-in-progress PhD thesis of mine. It is not intended to be read by anyone except me (and maybe few other people) yet. If you do flick through it anyway, consider yourself warned. It might be messy at some places and will definitely undergo serious rewriting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work can be read online at https://petrpajdla.github.io/dataInfrastructures/. The source repository is on GitHub at https://github.com/petrpajdla/dataInfrastructures/.\n\n\n\nThis document is created in an open-source Quarto scientific and technical publishing system. You might be asking why is it published and written like this even if it is not intended for any audiences except myself yet. I have no answer to this. One evening I simply decided to give Quarto publishing a try and set this whole thing up in less then an hour or so.\n\nNotes on writing\nThis note is written mostly for a future me, in case I need to set up the working environment again on a different machine and to serve as a memo if I forget how to continue.\nAs of November 2022, this is written on Archlabs GNU/Linux machine, mostly in Visual Studio Code editor and sometimes in RStudio. Changes are trackeg with Git and a remote repository is on GitHub (see the note above), same as the rendered website. The rendered version of the manuscript is in the branch gh-pages. See a guide on how to set this up here. The online version is published with this command:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto publish gh-pages\n\nIn my point of view, there are numerous advantages to scientific writing in this manner over traditional Office-based approach. A non-exhaustive list of why to do scientific writing this way is below.\n\nPlain text\nWriting in plain text enhanced with a simple Markdown syntax and some Quarto elements is great because from one source document, a .pdf, .html, .docx (and probably more) document formats can be rendered using pandoc.\nVersion control\nTracking changes using git is easily implemented when writing in a plain text. Keeping track of any changes in the manuscript is obviously crucial for any later revisions etc.\nSimple citation management\nBibliography is organized using Zotero with Better BibTeX extension which is used to export (and keep updated) necessary collections in a parent folder of the manuscript as .bib files. My Zotero library is here. To format the citations, a citation style of the Journal of Computer Applications in Archaeology is used (.csl file was obtained here).\nEmbedded code\nCode blocks (and the associated results) can be easily embedded in the text. My language of choice is R. For more information on reproducibility see Marwick (2017) and Marwick, Boettiger, and Mullen (2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-text citations\n\n\n\n\n\n@citekey        -> Author (year)\n-@citekey       -> (year)\n[@citekey]      -> (Author, year)\n@citekey [p.

    "text": "Thesis outline\nIn Chapter 1, Theory, the foundation is given by defining basic terms, data, data infrastructures etc. Then, theoretical approaches the work spans from are discussed and the concept of data in archaeology theorized. The dichotomy between archaeology as data- and/or theory-driven science is debated.\nIn Chapter 2, Method, methodological boundaries are set up.\nChapter 3, Data, introduces data sources that are used here. Understanding the data models employed in various data sources is vital for any subsequent steps taken in the analytical process. Special attention is thus given to analyzing how reality and facts are represented by the data models of used sources. A data management plan (Section 3.1) details how data is handled in this research."

As Kitchin (2022, 15) states, “Data are not simply captured or recorded, but are the product of discursively framed and technically mediated processes.”\n“The production of data is a social practice, conducted through structured and structuring fields (e.g. methods, concepts, expertise, institutions) that are shaped by and contribute to configurations of power and knowledge.” (Ruppert, Isin, and Bigo 2017)\n“(…) databases are designed and build to hold certain kinds of data and enable certain kinds of analysis, and how they are structured has profound consequences as to what queries and analysis can be performed.” (Ruppert 2012)\n\n\n1.1.2 Data infrastructures\nAs I was saying in the Section 1.1.1."

This text was written in plain text with some basic markdown and quarto syntax for formatting, cross references, citations etc. At some places there are R code blocks. The text is processed into three outputs, a website (HTML document), a PDF document and a MS Word document using Quarto. The plain text version, same as the rendered website, is hosted at GitHub. The text was mostly written in the Visual Code Studio, analysis were mostly performed using Rstudio or terminal. Library was organized using Zotero.\nRaster graphics were created and edited using GIMP, vecor graphics using Inkscape. All the GIS operations that required graphical user interface (GUI), or were more conveniently performed in a GUI, were done in QGIS.\nSome data were prepared, extracted or processed using basic GNU/Linux shell or SQL commands or scripts. Data from Wikidata was queried using SPARQL. Any analysis was mostly done in R, a language for statistical computing and graphics (rcore?). Various packages were used, the most important packages are lsited here, the complete list is in an Appendix\n\n2.1.1 Reproduciblity"

The data management plan (DMP) then stands at the very beginning of every such endeavour. In its essence, a DMP is a stand-alone document detailing how data is handled at each of the steps in its life cycle. This implies that it is not a static, but a living record of how the data was gathered and/or captured, curated, selected, analyzed, interpreted, shared and archived in the course of a project or after its end. A DMP helps in adhering to the FAIR principles, i.e. making data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, a set of propositions enabling more effective knowledge discovery, collaboration, and data reuse (Wilkinson et al. 2016; Hollander et al. 2019).\nThis DMP is partly based on the structure given in the Data Stewardship Wizard (Pergl et al. 2019), an online tool dedicated to cooperative creation of DMPs, templates created in the Ariadne project (Doorn and Ronzino 2022) and my own ingenuity.\n\n3.1.1 Re-using data\n\n\n3.1.2 Creating and collecting data\n\n\n3.1.3 Processing data\n\n\n3.1.4 Interpreting data\n\n\n3.1.5 Preserving data\n\n\n3.1.6 Giving access to data"
