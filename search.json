    "text": "Warning\n\n\n\nThis is a website for the work-in-progress PhD thesis of mine. It is not intended to be read by anyone except me (and maybe few other people) yet. If you do flick through it anyway, consider yourself warned. It might be messy at some places and will definitely undergo serious rewriting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work can be read online at https://petrpajdla.github.io/dataInfrastructures/. The source repository is on GitHub at https://github.com/petrpajdla/dataInfrastructures/.\n\n\n\nThis document is created in an open-source Quarto scientific and technical publishing system. You might be asking why is it published and written like this even if it is not intended for any audiences except myself yet. I have no answer to this. One evening I simply decided to give Quarto publishing a try and set this whole thing up in less then an hour or so.\n\n\nThis note is written mostly for a future me, in case I need to set up the working environment again on a different machine and to serve as a memo if I forget how to continue.\nAs of November 2022, this is written on Archlabs GNU/Linux machine, mostly in Visual Studio Code editor and sometimes in RStudio. Changes are trackeg with Git and a remote repository is on GitHub (see the note above), same as the rendered website. The rendered version of the manuscript is in the branch gh-pages. See a guide on how to set this up here. The online version is published with this command:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto publish gh-pages\n\nIn my point of view, there are numerous advantages to scientific writing in this manner over traditional Office-based approach. A non-exhaustive list of why to do scientific writing this way is below.\n\nPlain text\nWriting in plain text enhanced with a simple Markdown syntax and some Quarto elements is great because from one source document, a .pdf, .html, .docx (and probably more) document formats can be rendered using pandoc.\nVersion control\nTracking changes using git is easily implemented when writing in a plain text. Keeping track of any changes in the manuscript is obviously crucial for any later revisions etc.\nSimple citation management\nBibliography is organized using Zotero with Better BibTeX extension which is used to export (and keep updated) necessary collections in a parent folder of the manuscript as .bib files. My Zotero library is here. To format the citations, a citation style of the Journal of Computer Applications in Archaeology is used (.csl file was obtained here).\nEmbedded code\nCode blocks (and the associated results) can be easily embedded in the text. My language of choice is R. For more information on reproducibility see Marwick (2017) and Marwick, Boettiger and Mullen (2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-text citations\n\n\n\n\n\n@citekey        -> Author (year)\n-@citekey       -> (year)\n[@citekey]      -> (Author, year)\n@citekey [p.

    "text": "The term data is used in a plural form what is the current scientific convention (Kitchin 2022, xvii). As Kitchin (2022: 15) states, “Data are not simply captured or recorded, but are the product of discursively framed and technically mediated processes.”\n“The production of data is a social practice, conducted through structured and structuring fields (e.g. methods, concepts, expertise, institutions) that are shaped by and contribute to configurations of power and knowledge.” (Ruppert, Isin and Bigo 2017)\n“(…) databases are designed and build to hold certain kinds of data and enable certain kinds of analysis, and how they are structured has profound consequences as to what queries and analysis can be performed.” (Ruppert 2012)\n\n\n\nAs I was saying in the Section 1.1.1."
