### 1. What data will you collect or create?

::: answer


#### Re-used datasets



We have found the following non-reference datasets that we have
considered for re-use:

-

    **Archaeological Map of the Czech Republic** (AMCR)
    <!-- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/type-knowledgebase_and_repository-blue) -->

    The Archaeological Map of the Czech Republic (AMCR) is a repository
    designed for information on archaeological investigations, sites and
    finds, operated by the Archaeological Institutes of the CAS in
    Prague and Brno. The archives of these institutions contain
    documentation of archaeological fieldwork on the territory of the
    Czech Republic from 1919 to the present day, and they continue to
    enrich their collections. The AMCR database and related documents
    form the largest collection of archaeological data concerning the
    Czech Republic and are therefore an important part of our cultural
    heritage. The AMCR digital archive contains various types of
    records - individual archaeological documents (texts, field
    photographs, aerial photographs, maps and plans, digital data),
    projects, fieldwork events, archaeological sites, records of
    individual finds and a library of 3D models. Data and descriptive
    information are continuously taken from the AMCR and presented in
    the the AMCR Digital Archive interface.


#### Data formats and types

We will be using the following data formats and types:

-

    **Comma-separated Values** (CSV)
    <!-- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/type-model_and_format-blue) -->

    A comma-separated values (CSV) file is a delimited text file that
    uses a comma to separate values. Each line of the file is a data
    record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by
    commas. The use of the comma as a field separator is the source of
    the name for this file format. A CSV file typically stores tabular
    data (numbers and text) in plain text, in which case each line will
    have the same number of fields.



    It is a standardized format. This is a suitable format for long-term
    archiving. We will have only a small amount of data stored in this
    format.

::: {#q-how-data .question}
### 2. How will the data be collected or created?

::: answer
There will be no instrument dataset in this project.

#### Data storage and file conventions

The project will require so little storage space for all data and
software (including temporary storage) that it is not a problem.

We will use a filesystem with files and folders. We document how we
manage file versioning for files and folders.

We will not be storing data in an \"object/document store\" system.

We will not use a database system to store project data.

## Section B: Documentation and Meta-data

::: {#q-docs-metadata .question}
### 3. What documentation and meta-data will accompany the data?

::: answer
List of data to be published is given in Section E, Question 9. This
also includes information about catalogs where the data can be found.
Information about data types used is given in Section A, Question 1.

We will include keywords and relevant ontology references to optimise
the possibility for discovery and potential reuse.

Metadata will be openly available. Metadata will available in a form
that can be harvested and indexed (managed by the used repository /
repositories).

::: {#q-ethical-issues .question}
### 4. How will you manage any ethical issues?

::: answer
#### Data we collect

We will not collect any data connected to a person, i.e. \"personal
data\".

The data collection is not subject to ethical legislation.
:::

::: {#q-ethical-issues .question}
### 5. How will you manage copyright and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) issues?

::: answer
We will be working with the philosophy *as open as possible* for our
data.

All of our data can become completely open over time.

Limited embargo will not be used as all data will be opened.

All data will be owned by the Principal Investigator.

For the reference and non-reference data sets that we reuse, conditions
are as follows:

    It is freely available with obligation to quote the source (e.g.

::: {#sec-storage-backup .section .dmp-section}
## Section D: Storage and Backup

::: {#q-store-backup .question}
### 6. How will the data be stored and backed up during the research?

::: answer
Data that project members themselves store adequately backed up and
traceable. Therefore data are protected against both equipment failure
and human error.
:::
:::

::: {#q-access-security .question}
### 7. How will you manage access and security?

::: answer
Project members will not store data or software on computers in the lab
or external hard drives connected to those computers.They can carry data
with them on password-protected laptops. All data centers where project
data is stored carry sufficient certifications. All project web services
are addressed via secure HTTP (https://\...). Project members have been
instructed about both generic and specific risks to the project.

The possible impact to the project or organization if information is
lost is small. The possible impact to the project or organization if
information is leaked is small. The possible impact to the project or
organization if information is vandalised is small.

We are not using any personal information.

### 8. Which data are of long-term value and should be retained, shared, and/or preserved?

::: answer
:::
:::

::: {#q-longterm-plan .question}
### 9. What is the longterm preservation plan for the dataset?

::: answer
None of the used repositories charge for their services.

We have a reserved budget for the time and effort it will take to
prepare the data for publication.

::: {#sec-data-sharing .section .dmp-section}
## Section F: Data Sharing

::: {#q-how-share .question}
### 10. How will you share the data?

::: answer
Information about used repositories (i.e. where will potential users
find out about the data) is provided in Section E, Question 9.

Embargo on the data is described in Section C, Question 5, and Section
F, Question 11.
:::
:::

::: {#q-restrictions .question}
### 11. Are any restrictions on data sharing required?

::: answer
Ethical and legal restrictions are documented under Section C. We have
used the Data Stewardship Wizard, which made us aware of options to
minimize the restrictions.

No data sharing agreement will be required.

We are not running the project in a collaboration between different
groups nor institutes. Therefore, no collaboration agreement related to
data access is needed.

standardizing metadata and the associated data submitted for storage,
use and maintenance within a data centre or repository.

::: {#q-required-resources .question}
### 13. What resources will you require to deliver your plan?

::: answer
To execute the DMP, no additional specialist expertise is required.

We do not require any hardware or software in addition to what is
usually available in the institute.

Charges applied by data repositories (if any) are mentioned already in
Section E, Question 9.
