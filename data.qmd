## Note
This chapter, especially the @sec-dmp: Data management plan, builds up on the project [Data management in Archaeology](https://www.phil.muni.cz/en/research/current-projects/57940) I cooperated on with Hana Kubelkov√° in 2021 at the Department of Archaeology and Museology, Faculty of Arts, Masaryk University.

## Overview {.unnumbered}

@sec-data details:

- How data is managed in this research. This is described in a data management plan (@sec-dmp).
- What data sources are available in the Czech Republic (@sec-sources).
- What data models are most commonly used in Czech archaeology.
- How is the reality represented in the databases of the *Archaeological information system of the Czech Republic* (@sec-aiscr).

Sources of (archaeology) data in the Czech Republic, an overview:

Data models, datafication of past reality, simple vs complex data models;
Assessing findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR) principles;
Cultural heritage management data vs research data domains;
Archaeological information system of the Czech Republic (AIS CR) as the main data infrastructure. 


## Data management plan {#sec-dmp}

Good data stewardship is a crucial element in *Open Science* [@mons2018, p. 1-5], an umbrella concept for how scientific research is conducted in a way that knowledge is reusable, modifiable and redistributable. 
The data management plan (DMP) then stands at the very beginning of every such endeavour. 
In its essence, a DMP is a stand-alone document detailing how data is handled at each of the steps in its life cycle.
This implies that it is not a static, but a living record of how the data was gathered and/or captured, curated, selected, analysed, interpreted, shared and archived in the course of a project or after its end.
A DMP helps in adhering to the FAIR principles, i.e. making data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, a set of propositions enabling more effective knowledge discovery, collaboration, and data reuse [@wilkinson2016; @hollander2019].

This DMP is partly based on the structure given in the [Data Stewardship Wizard](ds-wizard.org) [@pergl2019], an online tool dedicated to cooperative creation of DMPs, templates created in the [Ariadne project](https://vast-lab.org/dmp/index.html) [@doorn2022] and my own ingenuity.

### Created, collected and re-used data

- Re-use
Are there pre-existing data?
License? Conditions for use?
How is it accessed?

- Creation and collection
Data formats?
Volumes of data? Suitable for LTP and sharing?

Aby used vocabularies, terminologies, ontologies?

Any metadata convention?
File naming conventions?
Persistent identifiers?

### Data processing

How will you work with the data?
Do you have/need storage?
Do you do backups?
Are you using object-store? Are you using relational database? Graph database? Triple store?
How are changes in data managed?

### Interpretation

Specify/list data formats you will be using and their structure.
Will different data be integrated?

### Data preservation

What data sets are you producing?
Is data long-term archived? Will it be usable and accessible after a long period of time?

### Access to data

Will the data be as open as possible?
What are the reasons your data cannot became open?

## Data sources {#sec-sources}

### Archaeology information system of the Czech Republic {#sec-aiscr}
