## How to run in your browser or download and run locally

The research compendium was initially set up with the [rrtools](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools/) package.
This research compendium has been developed using the statistical programming
language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
itself and optionally [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL:
[master.zip](/archive/master.zip). After unzipping:
- open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio
- run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the
[DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file).
- finally, open `analysis/paper/paper.Rmd` and knit to produce the `paper.docx`, or run `rmarkdown::render("analysis/paper/paper.Rmd")` in the R console
