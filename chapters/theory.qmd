## Definitions and terminology {#sec-terms}

This section presents a discussion of how I (and others) understand **data** and **data infrastructures**.
Data are a corner stone of this work and looking closely at how scholars, policy makers, and various other stakeholders define them is crucial for further understanding what is possible and what is not in the process of knowledge building.

### Data {#sec-terms-data}

In the current *information age*, word *data*[^1] is almost omnipresent and it became such a generic term that it is somewhat challenging to define.
Most of the definitions understand data as building blocks of *information* [e.g. @kitchin2022, 4].
These pieces of information are percieved as pre-factual and pre-analytical.
That is, in contrast to facts, false data are data nonetheless, disproven facts are no longer facts [@rosenberg2013, 17-18].
Thus data are understood as incontrovertible and non-deconstructibe units.
These assumptions migh lead to an impression that data exist in the outside world as entities or phenomena independent of the one observing them.
And this is indeed one way to comprehend data, as *'things given'* that just need to be discoverd [cf. @huggett2020a].
This inductive explanation of data brings in itself a danger that the process of discovering the data is viewed as an atheoretical endeavour.

[^1]: In this text, I adhere to the current scholarly convention as noted by @kitchin2022 [xvii], i.e. using term *data* in the plural form, with a singular form of *datum*.

On the contrary, data understood as *'things made'* are created at the moment when they are captured by observation, measurement, or derived from other data.
This implies theory-laden creative process of data generation, recording, etc.
In this case, it is clear that the one creating or recording the data does that based on the experience, objective and knowledge he/she has.
The whole process of data recording, creation, or capture is thus discursively framed and technically mediated [cf. @kitchin2022, 4-15; @huggett2020a].
As Kitchin notes, what we label as data are in fact *capta*, i.e. *'things taken'*.

@ruppert2017 voice the idea that the practice of data production does not happen through unstructured social (and/or political) practices, but through structured and structuring fields that add to configurations of power and knowledge.
In this section we went from understanding *data* as ubiquitous phenomena that are waiting out there to be discovered to *capta* that are actively and creatively made, recorded, generated etc. by a theory- and agenda-laden researcher.
What more, the practice of data production is recognized as being shaped by and contributing to structure of power and knowledge.
What data are recorded and how they are structured has consequences as to what can be later devised, i.e. what knowlege can be generated.

<!--
[@ruppert2017]:
"(...) the production of data is a social and often political practice that mobilizes agents who are not only objects of data (about whom data is produced) but that they are also subjects of data (those whose engagement drives how data is produced). Our question thus shifts to social practices and agents. Data does not happen through unstructured social practices but through structured and structuring fields in and through which various agents and their interests generate forms of expertise, interpretation, concepts, and methods that collectively function as fields of power and knowledge."

cited in [@kitchin2022]:
"The production of data is a social practice, conducted through structured and structuring fields (e.g. methods, concepts, expertise, institutions) that are shaped by and contribute to configurations of power and knowledge."

Talking about how chosen strategies in data recording and generation may influence the knowledge generated further along the way an idea of good and bad data might come to mind.
Bad data, like false data, do not exist.
Data can be useless, but their value is probably more determined by the current goal in mind.
Nevertheless, there are some signs of good-quality data as cited[^2] by @kitchin2022 [4]:

- they are discreet and intelligible, i.e. each datum is individual, separate and separable, and clearly defined;
- they are aggregative, that is they can be built into sets;
- they have associated metadata (data about data);
- they can be linked to other datasets to provide insights not available from a single dataset.

[^2]: Author's note: Kitchin cites @rosenberg2013, but I was not able to locate this part in Rosenberg's paper, which is primarily focused on the history of the term *data* in English language, not the quality of data.

<!-- "(...) databases are designed and build to hold certain kinds of data and enable certain kinds of analysis, and how they are structured has profound consequences as to what queries and analysis can be performed." [@ruppert2012] -->


### Infrastructures {#sec-terms-infra}

Although *infrastructures* became quite a buzzword in recent years both among the policy makers and researchers, it is rather difficult to define what an infrastructure actually is.
Many slightly different variations of more-less the same name and concept are circulating in official documents, various reports, research articles etc.
Thus, we encounter terms such as **research infrastructures**, large research infrastructures, open science infrastrucutres, **data infrastructures**, and perhaps more, even though most of their definitions are variations of the very same concept.

@hallonsten2020 maps the field of European (research) infrastructures and identifies the principal problem as the difficulty to come up with a single definition that would fit all of those who are considered to be (or consider themselves to be) an *infrastructure*.
@hallonsten2020 [630] concludes that:

> *(...) "while a politically viable definition seems to be either already in place (...) or unneeded, an analytically workable definition is out of reach unless the scope is limited and the aim of the definition is made more precise."*

In the next paragraphs, we look at several of the *political* definitions of research infrastructures and later we focus on an *analytical* definition of data infrastructures.

#### Political definitions

In the European Union, research infrastructures are currently defined in the Article 2(1) of EU Regulation No 2021/695 establishing Horizon Europe [-@horizon] as facilities providing resources  and services for the research communities in their respective fields. These include:

- human resources, major scientific equipment or sets of instruments;
- collections, archives or scientific data, i.e. knowledge-related facilities;
- computing systems and communication networks;
- any other research and innovation infrastructure of a unique nature open to external users.

The *Regulation* also states that infrastructures may be used beyond research, i.e. for education, public services etc.
This broad definition given by the European Union covers almost any kind of an infrastructure.
In the legal framework of the Czech Republic, given by Act No 130/2002 Coll. on the Support of Research, Experimental Development and Innovation [-@zakon130], Article 2(2), *large research infrastructure* is defined as follow [english translation from Roadmap of Large Research Infrastructures -@roadmap2019]:

> *"(...) a facility necessary for conducting comprehensive research and development with high financial and technology demands, approved by the Government and established to be also used by other research organisations."*

This political definition is rather an opportunistic one in demanding that the infrastructure is approved by the Czech government and has high financial and technology demands.
Lastly, the UNESCO Open Science Recommendation [-@unesco2021] adds to the research infrastructures a strong element of open science, addressing them as *open science infrastructures*.

To conclude, the political definitions of research infrastructures are mostly broad enough to fit any kind of a facility, that is deemed appropriate.
This point is highlighted especially in the Czech definition, where an approval of the Government is required.
In general, there is an emphasis on provision of services (etc.) to various stakeholder communities and cooperation.
In the EU Regulation, a subset of a larger field of infrastructures is labeled *knowledge-related facilities*, it is exactly this part that is discussed here as *data infrastructures*.

#### Data infrastructures

@kitchin2022 [47-48] builds up the definition of data infrastructures by comparing them to *data holdings* and *data archives*.
*Data holdings* are any data stored informally, presumably by an individual (scientist), without long-term preservation or sharing for reuse in mind.
Such data are inevitably lost when the researcher retires, dies (etc.), because proper metadata descriptions are missing and the data, although they might be organised in some way, lack  documentation and it is difficult, if not impossible, to reconstruct the context of the data.
In contrast, *data archives* are formal collections that are structured, curated and documented by appropriate metadata with plans for preservation, access and discoverability.

The role of an interconnected digital world is then highlighted in Kitchin's definition of a data infrastructure [@kitchin2022, 50]:

> *"A data infrastructure is a digital means for storing, sharing, connecting and consuming data holdings and archives across the internet."*



In a broader sense, infrastructures are information systems, repositories, archives, databases, sets of equipment and instruments etc. shared by multiple shareholder groups that are essential in supporting open science and research.
